Both the human-written and AI-generated codes find the modulo multiplicative inverse, but they approach the problem differently. The AI code uses a more complex method, employing the extended Euclidean algorithm with recursion and addressing the zero situation. It includes a GCD check for coprimality. On the other hand, the human-written code is simpler, using a loop-based strategy with an explicit coprimality check, but it doesn't handle the zero situation specifically. The AI code's complexity might boost performance, whereas the human-written code prioritizes readability and simplicity.
